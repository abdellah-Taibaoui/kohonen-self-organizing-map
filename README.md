# kohonen-self-organizing-map
A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low- dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map

The main advantage of using a SOM is that the data is easily interpretted and understood. The reduction of dimensionality and grid clustering makes it easy to observe similarities in the data.
